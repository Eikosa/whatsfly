# WhatsFly
## Just run and have fun. Just try and go fly.

> Make a pull request and fix my bad code.

WhatsApp web wrapper in Python. No selenium nor gecko web driver needed. 

setting up browser driver are tricky for python newcomers, and thus it makes your code soo laggy.

i knew that feeling. it was painful.

powered by Whatsmeow --a golang based WhatsApp library-- 'hopefully' will make this wrapper easy to use without sacrificing the speed and perfomance.

Thanks to Whatsmeow for amazing works. Inspired from tls-client, tiktoken, and whatsmeow.
