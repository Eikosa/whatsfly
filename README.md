WhatsApp web wrapper in Python. No selenium or gecko web driver needed. 

setting up browser driver are tricky for python newcomers, and thus it makes your code soo laggy.

i knew that feeling. it was painful.

powered by Whatsmeow --a golang based WhatsApp library-- 'hopefully' will make this wrapper easy to use without sacrificing the speed and perfomance.

Thanks to Whatsmeow for amazing works. Inspired from tls-client, tiktoken, and whatsmeow.
