# notes on building the main.go file

This repository is currently in the development phase. If your machine is not yet supported, you can still compile the main.go file on your own. Simply refer to the build.sh file for instructions on how to build the code. 

## The build.sh file was borrowed from https://github.com/bogdanfinn/tls-client/blob/master/cffi_dist/build.sh

## make sure you have installed all the build tools on your machine
