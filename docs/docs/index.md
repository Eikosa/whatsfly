## Usage

Here's a basic example to get you started with WhatsFly. This code demonstrates how to send a message and listen for incoming messages using WhatsFly.

### Code

```python
from whatsfly import WhatsApp
import time

def my_event_callback(event_data):
    ''' 
    Simple event callback to listen to incoming events/messages. 
    Whenever this function is called, it will retrieve the current incoming event or messages.
    '''
    print("Received event data:", event_data)

if __name__ == "__main__":

    phone = "6283139750000" # Make sure to attach country code + phone number
    message = "Hello World!"

    whatsapp = WhatsApp(event_callback=my_event_callback)

    whatsapp.connect()

    message_sent = whatsapp.sendMessage(phone=phone, message=message)
    
    time.sleep(5 * 60)  # Listen for messages for 5 minutes

    whatsapp.disconnect()
```

### Explanation

1. **Event Callback Function:**
   - `my_event_callback(event_data)` handles incoming events and simply prints the event data to the console.

2. **Main Program Flow:**
   - The phone number (with country code) and the message to be sent are defined.
   - An instance of `WhatsApp` is created with the event callback function.
   - The script connects to WhatsApp using the `connect()` method. At this point it should show a QR code, scan it with your phone (on Connected Devices)
   - A message is sent to the specified phone number using `sendMessage(phone, message)`.
   - The script listens for incoming messages for 5 minutes using `time.sleep(5 * 60)`.
   - Finally, it disconnects from WhatsApp using the `disconnect()` method.
